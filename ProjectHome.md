Ambition of this driver is to replace native Android ExifInterface. It allows user to read/modify every tag from Exif area.

This driver is written in pure JAVA, so it can be easily used in both JAVA and Android applications.Driver should work properly with both Exif native and JFIF images with Exif information included.
